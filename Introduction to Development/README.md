## <i>WnCC & Career Cell brings you course on Web Dev using React & NextJS </i>
<br>

When you design your WebApp and see it in action in front of you, it always gives you a highly joyful sensation. Due to the growing importance of web development for all developers, WnCC is offering a 4-week in-depth course on web programming utilising the widely used JavaScript Library React JS and framework NextJS. Within a month, you may learn to create stunning WebApps. You will study React in this course, a well-liked JavaScript library created by Facebook to create elegantly organised frontends for WebApps. React has a modest advantage over its competitors, which include the equally well-liked Angular and Vue.JS frameworks. For instance, while Angular makes it simple to integrate with Google services and authentication, but the Angular code is considerably longer than React's. After becoming familiar with React, we will move on to Next.JS, an open-source framework built on top of Node.js that enables server-side rendering and the creation of static webpages for React-based web apps. By the conclusion of this course, you will be an expert programmer in React and Next.JS and be able to create WebApps with stunning UI and server-side rendering.<br>
